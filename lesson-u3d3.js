   Unit 3 · Day 3 — Three Portfolios, Same Money
   v3 — teaches formula CONSTRUCTION, not formula transcription.

   Every step body walks the same four questions instead of dictating a
   string to retype:

        WANT     what do I want out of this cell?
        HAVE     what do I already have, and in which cells?
        CONNECT  what joins them — an operator, or a function?
        SHAPE    does the answer need rounding to be readable?

   The literal formula lives in `hint`, so a stuck student can still get
   it, but nobody is handed it before they have made the four decisions.
   Step 7 makes them choose functions by name from a description, which
   is the actual skill — knowing MIN exists is useless if you cannot
   recognise the moment you need it.
